# miles-combo-leecher
i made this myself works on all platforms im still pretty much a python beginner so not the greatest code scrapes throwbin for combos with your keyword then puts them all in a txt

Installation:
 
apt-get install tor
 
pip3 install GoogleScraper
 
pip3 install requests
 
apt-get install dos2unix
 
Usage:
 
service tor start
 
./gatherlinks.sh; # this will gather your links to leechedlinks.txt
 
python3 MILES-LEECHER.py inputfile outputfile # if you used gatherlinks.sh your inputfile is leechedlinks.txt
 
once it stops moving and it gets stuck at one place you can hit control c its most likely done
